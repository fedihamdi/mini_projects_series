# Deep Learning for predicting energy use in the UK

## Using LSTM architecture to predict the energy use in UK

In this project I use the neural network architecture on the dataset of energy use in UK from 2012 to 2019.

---

Data dictionnairy : 

1. timestamp : the date index from 2012 to 2019
2. solar : solar energy consummed in UK
3. nuclear : nuclear energy consummed in UK
4. wind : wind energy consummed in UK
5. hydro : hydro energy consummed in UK

As a first attempt I am only modeling the Solar energy consumption
