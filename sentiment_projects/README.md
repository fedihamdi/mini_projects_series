# Intro

This is a repo for some mini sentiment projects

1. A project about the Netflix famous series: "Squid Game" 

During this project we search to model the feeling of the user's comment and critic in AlloCiné website. Basically the work strats by analysing and cleaning the data (aka preprocessing) after that building a dump naïve model to Benchmark over by using the scikit-learn mdoels. I used Bernoulli, Multinomial and Gaussian Naive Bayes
